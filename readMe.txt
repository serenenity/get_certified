Hello devs.

so, this is a quick step to get everyone on board.

####### INSTALLATION #######
After you fetch from the repo do the following
1. install a virtual environment inside the main repo with the command below:
py -3 -m venv .venv
2. activate your virtual environment with the command below:
.venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install your Flask
pip install Flask
4. Run development server:
flask Run

####### DEVELOPMENT TASKS ########
    We are building an application or cloning cs50 certification.
I am sharing the development into the following roles.
1. design role
Stephen will be working on both how the users sign up using the names and passwords and what the user will see after the signup, ie their generated certification

2. development role
Mike and mark will be working together on the backend side
i. ensure and check user data 
ii. display user certification 
iii. allow user to download certification as pdf.


###### RUNNING YOUR SERVER #######
Before you run your server always ensure you activate the server again
Also, I am yet to figure how to keep the server running so i keep restarting my own server to see my changes.

if any of you obser any thing please let me know about it.


Best.
